/* When you check the login you need to get username, password and salt from database where username = the username they said
/* If that doesn't exist error
/* If that does exist check if the password (hash) is equal to the hash you created for the username
/* I suggested this if(md5(salt.md5(PostedPassword) == PasswordFromDB)*/
