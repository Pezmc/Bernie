 * When one of the four individual icons buttons are pressed the system will loop through that category and find one that matches the users interests. 
 * It will not be one that has previously been liked or disliked (unless there are no more that haven't been liked of disliked in which case it will 
 * randomly choose one of the already liked items). Then it will randomly choose 3 more items with matching or similar tags to the 'feature' item.
 *
 * If a category is set it only uses that category, else chooses one at random
 *
 * Usage: Imported by index when this page is requested
